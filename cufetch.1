.TH CUSTOMFETCH "1" "August 2024" "customfetch @VERSION@ branch @BRANCH@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
customfetch \- A command\-line and GUI system information tool (or neofetch like program)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cufetch
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH CONFIGURATION
customfetch focus point is to be customizable and fast at the same time.
.PP
How does it work?
.PP
We use the \fBconfig.toml\fR file, in there we got an array variable called "layout". That's the variable where you customize how the infos should be displayed.
.PP
You have 5 tags:
.nf
* \fB$<module.member>\fR - Used for printing the value of a member of a module.
* \fB${color}\fR - Used for displaying text in a specific color.
* \fB$(bash command)\fR - Used to execute bash commands and print the output.
* \fB$[something,equalToSomething,ifTrue,ifFalse]\fR - Conditional tag to display different outputs based on the comparison.
.fi
* \fB$%n1,n2%\fR - Used to print the percentage and print with colors
.PP
They can be used in the ascii art text file and layout, but how to use them?
.br
Here's a simple bare-minimal example:
.nf
layout = [
	"My OS is $<os.name>, and username is $<user.name>",
	"The color of the following text will be ${red}red",
	"This is a $(echo \\"bash command\\")",
	"Check if \\\\$<user.name> is correct: $[$<user.name>,toni,indeed,it's not toni but $(echo $USER)]",
	"The discount between 50$ and 100$ is $%50,100%"
]
.fi
.PP
* The \fBInfo tag $<>\fR will prints the value of a member of a module.
.br
  All the modules and their members are listed in the `--list-modules` argument
.PP
* The \fBColor tag ${}\fR is used for printing the text of a certain color.
.nf
  The colors can be predefined such as: \fIblack\fR, \fIred\fR, \fIgreen\fR, \fIblue\fR, \fIcyan\fR, \fIyellow\fR, \fImagenta\fR, \fIwhite\fR and they can be configured in the config file.
  They can have hexcodes colors (e.g "#5522dd").
  You can apply special effects to colors by using the following symbols before the '#' in hex codes:
      \fBTerminal and GUI\fR                   \fBGUI Only\fR
  * \fBb\fR  for background color.     * \fBo\fR        for overline
  * \fBu\fR  to  underline the text    * \fBa(value)\fR for fg alpha (either a plain integer between 1 and 65536 or a percentage value like `50%`)
  * \fB!\fR  for bold text             * \fBL(value)\fR to  underline with a style (`none`, `single`, `double`, `low`, `error`)
  * \fBi\fR  for italic text           * \fBU(value)\fR for choosing the underline color (hexcode without #)
                                 * \fBB(value)\fR for bg color text (hexcode without #)
      \fBTerminal Only\fR
 *  \fBl\fR  for blinking text
.fi
.PP
  Alternatively, ANSI escape codes can be used, e.g "\\e[1;31m" and "\\e[38;5;160m".
.PP
  You can also use them inside the tag, like \fB${!#343345}\fR or \fB${\\e[1;31m}\fR.
.PP
  To reset colors, use \fB${0}\fR for a normal reset or \fB${1}\fR for a bold reset.
.PP
  To use the colors that the ascii art logo uses, use \fB${auto}\fR for getting the 1st color, \fB${auto4}\fR for the 4th one and so on.
.br
  If you're using GUI mode and wants to display a custom source that's an image, all the auto colors will be the same colors as the distro ones
.PP
* The \fBConditional tag $[]\fR is used to display different outputs based on the comparison.
.br
  The syntax \fBMUST\fR be: $[something,equalToSomethingElse,ifTrue,ifFalse] \fBnote:\fR putting spaces could change the expected result
.br
  Each part can have a tag or anything else.
.PP
  For example: $[$<user.name>,$(echo $USER),correct,NOT correct]
.br
  This is useful when on some terminal or WM the detection can be different than others
.PP
* The \fBBash command tag $()\fR speaks for itself.
.br
  It can execute normal bash commands and print the output of it.
.PP
  \fBNOTE:\fR if you try to use programs such as cbonsai in an ASCII art, put a '!' before the command.
.br
  example: $(!cbonsai -p)
.PP
* The \fBPercentage tag $%%\fR is used for displaying the percentage between 2 numbers.
.br
  It \fBMust\fR contain a comma for separating the 2. They can be either be taken from a tag or it put yourself.
.br
  For example: $%50,100%
.br
  For inverting colors of bad and great (red and green), before the first '%' put '!' (without quotes ofc)
.PP
To escape any $ or bracket, just use \\
