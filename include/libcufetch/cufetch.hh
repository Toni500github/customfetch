 * It registers recursively and will include them automatically.
 *
 * Real example: $<github.profile.following>  
 *   - github = root module  
 *   - profile = submodule of github  
 *   - following = submodule of profile
 *
 * The handler is executed when the module is invoked in the layout.
 * If it's NULL, it returns "(unknown/invalid module)"
 *
 * Code example:
 * module_t submodule_foo = {"idk", "description", {}, submodule_foo_callback};
 * module_t foo = {"foo", "description", {std::move(submodule_foo)}, foo_callback};
 * cfRegisterModule(foo); // you can call $<foo> and $<foo.idk> from the layout.
