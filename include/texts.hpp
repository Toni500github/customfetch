    -a, --ascii-logo-type <TYPE>
                                Type of ASCII art (typically "small", "old", or empty for default).
                                Example: "-d arch -a older" looks for "arch_older.txt".

    -D, --data-dir <PATH>       Path to data directory containing "ascii/" subfolder with distro logos.

    --disallow-command-tag      Do not allow command tags $() to be executed.
                                This is a safety measure for preventing malicious code to be executed because you didn't want to check the config first.

INFORMATIONAL:
    -l, --list-modules          List all available info tag modules (e.g., $<cpu> or $<os.name>).
    -w, --how-it-works          Explain tags and general customization.

                                Use inferior <NUM> than 200 to disable. Press 'q' to exit.

EXAMPLES:
    1. Minimal output with default logo:
       customfetch --no-color

    2. Custom distro logo with live updates:
       customfetch --distro "arch" --loop-ms 1000

    3. Override layout and colors:
       customfetch -m "${magenta}OS: $<os.name>" --color "magenta=#FF00FF"

For details, see `man customfetch` or run `--how-it-works`.
)");

constexpr std::string_view explain_customfetch = (R"(
customfetch is designed for maximum customizability, allowing users to display system information exactly how they want it.
The layout and logo is controlled through special tags that can output system info, execute commands, apply conditional logic, add colors, and calculate percentages with some colors.

Tag References:
1. Information Tag ($<>)
    Retrieves system information from modules.

    Syntax: $<module.submodule.sub...> or $<module>

    Examples:
    - $<user.name>       # Displays login username
    - $<os.kernel.name>  # Shows kernel name only
    - $<ram>             # Shows formatted RAM usage

    Use `--list-modules` to see all available modules and members.

2. Bash Command Tag ($())
    Executes shell commands and outputs the result.
    Supports full shell syntax including pipes and redirection.

    Syntax: $(command)

    Examples:
    - $(echo "hello")             # Outputs: hello
    - $(date +%F)                 # Shows current date
    - $(uname -r | cut -d'-' -f1) # Shows kernel version number only

3. Conditional Tag ($[])
    Displays different outputs based on conditions.

    Syntax: $[condition,comparison,true_output,false_output]

    Examples:
    - $[$<user.name>,toni,Welcome back!,Access denied]
    - $[$(date +%m-%d),12-25,Merry Christmas!,]
    - $[$<os.name.id>,arch,${green}I use arch btw,${red}Non-arch user]

4. Color Tag (${})
    Applies colors and text formatting.

    Basic syntax: ${color} or ${modifiers#RRGGBB}

    Color options:
    - Named colors from config
    - Hex colors: ${#ff00cc}
    - Special colors: ${auto} (uses logo colors)
    - Reset styles: ${0} (normal), ${1} (bold reset)

    Formatting modifiers (prefix before hexcolor):
    - ! = Bold
    - u = Underline
    - i = Italic
    - s = Strikethrough
    - l = Blink (terminal only)
    - b = Background color

    Advanced GUI-only modifiers:
    - o        = Overline
    - a(value) = Foreground alpha (1-65536 or 0%-100%)
    - L(value) = Underline style (none/single/double/low/error)
    - U(color) = Underline color (hex)
    - B(color) = Background color (hex)
    - S(color) = Strikethrough color (hex)
    - O(color) = Overline color (hex)
    - A(value) = Background alpha (1-65536 or 0%-100%)
    - w(value) = Font weight (light/normal/bold/ultrabold or 100-1000)

    Examples:
GUI App only:
        ${oU(#ff0000)L(double)}Error            # Double red underline
        ${a(50%)#00ff00}Semi-transparent green
    Cross-platform:
        ${\e[1;33m}Bold yellow
        ${b#222222}${white}White on gray
        ${auto3}The 3rd logo color

    Notes:
    - customfetch will try to convert ANSI escape codes to GUI app equivalent
    - customfetch will ignore GUI-specific modifiers on terminal.
    - if you're using the GUI app and want to display a custom logo that's an image, all the auto colors will be the same colors as the distro ones.

5. Percentage Tag ($%%)
    Calculates and displays colored percentages.

    Syntax: $%value,total% or $%!value,total% (inverted colors)

    Examples:
    - $%$<ram.used>,$<ram.total>%
    - $%!50,100% (shows red if low)
    - $%$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity),100%

Pro Tip:
- Combine tags for powerful formatting:
  ${u#5522dd}$[$(date +%H),12,Good ${yellow}morning,Good ${#ff8800}afternoon]

FAQ:
Q: Why do special characters (&, <) break the GUI display?
A: Escape these characters with \\ (e.g replace "<" with "\\<" from both config and ASCII art):
   This doesn't affect terminal output.

Q: How can I use cbonsai as ASCII art?
A: 1. Create a text file containing: $(!cbonsai -p)
   2. Use: customfetch -s "/path/to/file.txt"
   3. Adjust offset for proper alignment

Q: Does customfetch support nested tags?
A: Yes! Complex nesting is supported, for example:
   $<disk($<disk($[1,1,$(echo -n $<disk(/).mountdir>),23]).mountdir>)>
)");
