# Customfetch
>[!WARNING]
>customfetch is still WIP, it will be ready with a release.\
>If you still wanna try, go ahead and compile it. Don't forget to open an issue/PR for any problem.\
>Thanks!

A system information fetch tool (or [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) like program), which its focus point is the customizability and perfomance.\
`customfetch` is designed to provide a really customizable way to display your system informations in the way you like or want.

Currently supports Linux distros only, but windows support is incoming
<!-- Comment this because it's still in WIP for 3 weeks, no shit it won't work on some OSs
>[!NOTE]
>The goal is to be cross-platform, so maybe Android and MacOS support will come some day\
>but if you're using a UNIX OS, such as FreeBSD or MINIX, or those "obscure" OSs\
>then some, if not most, query infos won't probably work.\
>So you may want to relay to shell commands for quering\
>or maybe continue using neofetch/fastfetch if it still works great for you

## Key Features

* **GUI support (GTK3)**
* Really customizable and fast, check [Config (with explanation)](#config-with-explanation) section
* Lightweight
>[!NOTE]
>enabling GUI support may slow down customfetch a bit because it needs to load the GUI libraries at runtime\
>To check if it's enabled or not, run "cufetch --version"

## Depends
currently nothing, if need to install with GUI support install: `gtk3 gtkmm3`

## Installation
### Arch and based (unstable) (AUR)
```bash
# btw checkout our other project https://github.com/BurntRanch/TabAUR ;)
taur -S customfetch-git

# GUI support
taur -S customfetch-gui-git
```

### Compile from source
```bash
# clone the git dir
git clone https://github.com/Toni500github/customfetch
cd customfetch

# DEBUG=0 for release build (it's just a build without debug infos)
# GUI_MODE=1 for having GUI mode, or =0 for not
make install DEBUG=0 GUI_MODE=1

# automatically generates a config and prints the infos
cufetch
```

## Config (with explanation)

Here's an example using my config

![image](screenshot.png)

The config:

```toml
[config]
layout = [
    "${red}$<user.name>${0}@${cyan}$<os.hostname>",
    "───────────────────────────",
    "${red}OS ->  $<os.name> $<system.arch>",
    "${yellow}Host -> $<system.host>",
    "${!#33ffa1}Init -> $<os.initsys_name>",
    "${green}Kernel -> $<os.kernel>",
    "${cyan}Uptime -> $<os.uptime>",
    "${cyan}Shell -> $<user.shell>",
    "${cyan}Packages -> $<os.pkgs>",
    "${!#448aa4}Disk(/) ->  $<disk(/).disk>",
    "${!#f11bba}WM -> $<user.wm_name>",
    "${!#f11f2a}DE -> $<user.de_name>",
    "${!#fff220}Terminal -> $<user.term>",
    "${magenta}CPU -> $<cpu.cpu>",
    "${blue}GPU -> $<gpu.name>",
    "${!#03ff93}RAM usage -> $<ram.ram>",
    "",
    "${\e[40m}   ${\e[41m}   ${\e[42m}   ${\e[43m}   ${\e[44m}   ${\e[45m}   ${\e[46m}   ${\e[47m}   ", # normal colors
    "${\e[100m}   ${\e[101m}   ${\e[102m}   ${\e[103m}   ${\e[104m}   ${\e[105m}   ${\e[106m}   ${\e[107m}   " # light colors
]

# Ordered list of which packages installed count should be displayed in $<os.pkgs>
# remember to not enter the same name twice, else the world will end
# Curennt choices: pacman, flatpak
#
# Pro-tip: if your package manager isnt listed here, yet,
# use the bash command module in the layout
# e.g "Packages: $(pacman -Q | wc -l)"
pkg-managers = ["pacman", "flatpak"]

# display ascii-art or image/gif (GUI only) near layout
# put "os" for displaying the OS ascii-art
# or the "/path/to/file" for displaying custom files
# or "off" for disabling ascii-art or image displaying
source-path = "os"

# offset between the ascii art and the system infos
offset = 5

# Path to where we'll take all the distros/OSs ascii arts
# it MUST contain an "ascii" subdirectory
data-dir = "/usr/share/customfetch"

# A string or character that when ecountered, will automatically
# reset color, aka. automatically append ${0}.
# Make it empty for disabling
sep-reset = "->"

# Colors can be with: hexcodes (#55ff88) and for bold put '!' (!#55ff88)
# OR ANSI escape code colors like "\e[1;34m"
# remember to add ${0} where you want to reset color
black = "\e[1;30m"
red = "\e[1;31m"
green = "\e[1;32m"
yellow = "\e[1;33m"
blue = "\e[1;34m"
magenta = "\e[1;35m"
cyan = "\e[1;36m"
white = "\e[1;37m"

# GUI options
# note: customfetch needs to be compiled with GUI_MODE=1 (check with "cufetch --version")
[gui]
enable = false

# Font to be used (Strongly reccomend family "Liberation Mono")
# syntax must be [FAMILY-LIST] [STYLE-OPTIONS] [SIZE]
# e.g "Liberation Mono Normal 12"
# check https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/Pango-1.0/classes/FontDescription.html#Pango.FontDescription for more infos
font = "Liberation Mono Normal Light 12"

# These are the colors palette you can use in the GUI mode.
# Can be used in the layout and/or ascii-art
# They can overwritte with ANSI escape code colors
# but they don't work with those, only hexcodes
black = "!#000005"
red = "!#ff2000"
green = "!#00ff00"
blue = "!#00aaff"
cyan = "!#00ffff"
yellow = "!#ffff00"
magenta = "!#f881ff"
white = "!#ffffff"
```

You may be confused and have difficulty to understand, but this is why customfetch is different from the others.\

We use something we call "components", 2 inspired by bash syntax, and they starts with a '$'. **We use them on both the ascii art text file and the `layout` variable**\
There are 3 componenets:

* **The info module** ($<>) lets you access a sub-member of a built-in module\
  e.g `$<user.name>` will print the username, `$<os.kernel_version>` will print the kernel version and so on.\
  run "cufetch -l" for a list of builti-in modules

* **The color module** (${}) displays the text with a color\
  e.g "${red}hello world" will indeed print "hello world" in red (or the color you set in the variable).\
  you can even put a custom hex color e.g: ${#ff6622} (for bold put '!' at start) OR bash escape code colors e.g ${\e[1;32m} or ${\e[0;34m}.\
  To reset color use ${0}

* **The bash command module** ($()) let's you execute bash commands.\
  e.g $(echo \"hello world\") will indeed echo out hello world\
  you can even use pipes:\
  e.g $(echo \"hello world\" | cut -d' ' -f2) will only print world

Any end brackets (')', '}', '>') can be escaped with \\
